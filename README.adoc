= Network-integrated Pre and Post-Processing in Scientic Computing

== Introduction
This project is part of the course "M2 Project" at the University of Strasbourg. The goal of this project is to develop a network-integrated pre and post-processing tool for scientific computing. The tool is based on the Feel++ library and is designed to be used in the context of thermoelectric simulations.


== Installation
Feel free to use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a docker image with all the necessary dependencies. To do so, run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t 2024m2projectbitter:latest .
```

== Usage
To run the program, make sure you have the proper permissions:
```bash
chmod +x run_seq run
```
Run the program sequentially:
```bash
./run_seq
```
Run the program on a cluster:
```bash
sbatch run
```

You can copy the results to your local machine, with the following command:
For docker:
```bash
docker ps # to get the container ID
docker cp <dockerID>:/home/feelppbd/project-bitter/np_1 /path/to/your/local/folder
```

For a cluster:
```bash
rsync -avz gaya:path/to/feelppdb path/to/your/local/folder
```

== Visualization
If you want to visualize our results without running the program, you can find them in the `thermoelectric.exports` folder. Simply open `Export.case` with Paraview to visualize the results. Note that a `Paraview-State.pvsm` file is also provided to load the state of the visualization in Paraview.
