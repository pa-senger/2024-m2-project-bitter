            Gmsh is an open‐source 3‐D finite element grid generator with a build‐in {CAD} engine and post‐processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and user‐friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities. This paper presents the overall philosophy, the main design choices and some of the original algorithms implemented in Gmsh. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
